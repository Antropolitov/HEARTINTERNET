HeartInternet Pentesting Framework v7.7.7
Coded by @rootkitov | NSA Backdoor Edition
üîπ Purpose of the utility
HeartInternet is a powerful framework for penetration testing (Pentesting), vulnerability analysis and cybersecurity. It is designed for:

Ethical hacking (legal security testing)

Auditing web applications and networks

Detecting vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, SSRF, RCE, etc.)

Conducting DoS/DDoS tests (for training purposes)

Collecting intelligence (OSINT)

Analyzing metadata (images, documents, web pages)

‚ö† ATTENTION: Using this tool without the permission of the system owner is illegal. Intended for legal testing and training only.

üîπ Main functionality
1. Network scanning (Stealth Mode)
Nmap integration for stealth port scanning

Detection of open ports and services

Detection of OS and software versions

2. Web vulnerability scanner (Deep Scan)
XSS (cross-site scripting)

SQL injections (SQLi)

SSRF (server request forgery)

LFI/RFI (local/remote file inclusion)

RCE (remote code execution)

3. Malicious code injection
Automatic payload injection (XSS, SQLi, LFI, RCE, Phishing)

Testing forms for vulnerabilities

Bypassing some WAF/filters

4. DoS/DDoS module (for testing)
SYN Flood (overloading TCP connections)

HTTP Flood (attack via proxy)

Slowloris (maintaining multiple connections)

DNS Amplification (DRDoS via DNS servers)

GoldenEye (Layer7 attack)

5. Metadata collection
Extract EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãfrom images (GPS, camera, shooting date)

PDF/DOC/XLS analysis (hidden data, macros)

WHOIS and DNS reconnaissance (domain owners, MX records)

Website parsing (search for forms, scripts, links)

6. Additional features
Tor integration for anonymity

Proxy support (HTTP/SOCKS)

Blockchain analysis (in development)

AI vulnerability scanning (experimental)

üîπ Usage examples
1. Web vulnerability scanning
python
1. Select "2. Web Vulnerability Scanner"
2. Enter the website URL (e.g. http://example.com)
3. Get a report about vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc.)

2. XSS injection
python
1. Select "8. Code Injection"
2. Enter URL and payload type (XSS/SQLi/RCE)
3. Check if the exploit worked
3. DoS testing (SYN Flood)
python
1. Select "5. DOS/DDOS Module" ‚Üí "1. SYN Flood"
2. Enter target IP and port
3. Launch attack (for legal testing only!)

4. PDF metadata analysis
python
1. Select "9. Document Analyzer"
2. Specify file path (e.g. report.pdf)
3. Get data: author, creation date, hidden text
üîπ Important warnings
‚ùå Do not use for illegal activities!
üîí Always use VPN/Tor/proxy for anonymity
üìú Use only with permission from the system owner

üöÄ Conclusion
HeartInternet is a versatile pentesting tool that combines automated scanning and manual testing methods. It is suitable for both novice cybersecurity professionals and experienced ethical hackers.![photo_6235674567238601481_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c68acd6-1eb2-4df8-80fc-200e56d56922)
